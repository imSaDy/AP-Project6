# AP HTTP - C++ Web Server

This project is a simple, server-side web application framework written in C++ for an Advanced Programming course. It is designed to handle HTTP requests, serve static content, and render dynamic templates.

The server appears to manage data for a university, including students, courses, professors, and majors, likely loaded from the `.csv` files.

## Features

* **HTTP Server:** Core server logic to handle `GET` and `POST` requests.
* **Static File Serving:** Serves static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS) from the `/static` directory.
* **Dynamic Templating:** Renders dynamic web pages using templates from the `/template` directory.
* **Data Handling:** Parses and manages data from `.csv` files (students, courses, etc.).
* **Modular Structure:** Organized with separate directories for server logic, utilities, and assets.

## Technologies Used

* **C++** (for all backend logic)
* **HTML** (for templates and static pages)
* **Makefile** (for build automation)
